[[Property:weight|7]]
To move a class from a cluster to another one, you have to use the [[Diagram tool: Introduction|Diagram tool]] . First, [[Centering tools on a component|center the tool]]  on the cluster that contains the class you want to move. Then, if the destination cluster is not shown on the diagram, [[Pick-and-drop mechanism|pick]]  it in the [[Cluster tool: Introduction|cluster tool]]  and drop it in the [[Diagram tool: Introduction|diagram]] . Once both clusters are displayed, you just have to drag the class to its destination.
