The design of Eiffel the language has remained largely static over its life, arguably due to its sound initial design. Still, on occasion there is value in evolving and adapting to new challenges. To accommodate this evolution, the Eiffel Software compiler provides a set of compilation variants which offer a balance of syntax support. This starts with compatibility with previously valid syntax, moves through the latest standard, and forward to language features which are supported but not yet etched into the standard.
