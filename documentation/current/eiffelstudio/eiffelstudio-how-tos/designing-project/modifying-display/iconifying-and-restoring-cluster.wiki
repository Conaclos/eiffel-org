* If you do not want to hide the cluster, only its contents, iconify it by double clicking on the cluster label. Double clicking it again returns the cluster to its normal state.

{{tip| '''Tip''': If the entire cluster is of no relevance to your diagram, [[Removing items from a view|hide it from the view]]  altogether. }}
