[[Property:title|Setting the command line arguments]]
[[Property:weight|6]]
To debug a program that uses command line parameters, it is possible to have the debugger call the generated program with certain command line arguments automatically.

To change the command line arguments used when debugging:
* Open the Debug, Debugging Options Dialog 
* In this dialog, you can change the current arguments and also store and load argument sets. 
* Click '''OK'''. 

{{tip| '''Tip''': To get the command line arguments in a program, it is possible to either define the root feature as taking an array of [[ref:/libraries/base/reference/string_8_chart|STRING_8]]  objects, or to use the [[ref:/libraries/base/reference/arguments_chart|ARGUMENTS]]  class, which provides a lot of functionality linked with command line arguments. }}
