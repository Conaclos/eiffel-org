==Graphical environment==

===What's new===
* Innovative testing tools let you automatically test your  software, extract test cases from failed execution as well as manually creating your own test cases.
* Added ability to automatically license your Eiffel classes each time you  save a class.
* Added the '''argument_parser''' library which provides an easy way to manipulate command line arguments.
* Added a new version of the EiffelNet library with IPv6 support.  Because it has some breaking changes, the library is called '''net_ipv6''' and  can  be, in most cases, be used in place of   the original EiffelNet library.

===Improvements===
* Improved the library choice dialog which  can also be customized to include your own locations.
* Added support for <eiffel>note</eiffel> keyword and the updated <eiffel>variant</eiffel> keyword location in a loop through the environment.
