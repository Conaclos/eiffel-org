===Changes===

===Bug fixes===

* Fixed the saving of the diagrams to PNG.

==Libraries==

===EiffelBase===
* <e>ARRAY</e>:
** Made <e>{ARRAY}.make</e> and <e>{ARRAY}.conservative_resize</e> obsolete as they are not void safe. Instead use <e>{ARRAY}.make_empty</e>, <e>{ARRAY}.make_filled</e> or <e>{ARRAY}.conservative_resize_with_default</e>.
** Added <e>{ARRAY}.rebase</e> that would help creating an empty array with a given `lower'. 
** Rewrote <e>BOUNDED_QUEUE</e> and <e>BOUNDED_STACK</e> to use the same implementation of <e>ARRAYED_QUEUE</e> and <e>ARRAYED_STACK</e>, the only difference is that `extendible' is defined to be False. The `correct_mismatch' feature has been updated to ensure retrieval.
* <e>FORMAT_DOUBLE</e>:
** Fixed eweasel test#lib036 in <e>FORMAT_DOUBLE</e>where `pad_fraction' did not process properly when one decided to not show the trailing zeros and there were only zeros after the decimal point.
** Fixed the post-condition of <e>{FORMAT_DOUBLE}.pad_fraction</e> to reflect that the count is set to `decimals' but only when one shows the trailing zeros.
* Added <e>WEAK_REFERENCE</e> to allow weak references in an Eiffel system. This supersedes the <e>IDENTIFIED</e> class which required to change your code to allow weak referencing. Currently the class is only implemented for classic Eiffel, it is not available when compiling for .NET. 
* Added new Eiffel tracing facility classes <e>TRACING_HANDLER</e> and <e>TRACING_SETTING</e> which let you capture some information about the current execution via callbacks.
* Fixed eweasel test#list010 with twinning and deep_twinning of a <e>FIXED_LIST</e> that would reset `capacity' to `count'.
* Added <e>{TYPE}.is_expanded</e> to find out if a type is expanded or not.
