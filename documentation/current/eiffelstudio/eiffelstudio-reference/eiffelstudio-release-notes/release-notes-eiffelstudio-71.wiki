==Graphical environment==

===What's new===
* New SCOOP processor garbage collection which now lets you create more than 1500 processors during one execution. There is still a limit on the number of concurrent processors you might have.

===Improvements===
* Better copy/paste of code to avoid useless reformatting after copying and pasting a block of text.
* Better formatting of Eiffel source code when using the pretty printer.
* Better performance of SCOOP runtime for certain types of concurrent calls.
* Printing in postscript mode now allowed on Unix (previously, printing always defaulted to RTF).

===Changes===

===Bug fixes===
* Fixed issue with automatically generated tests which included tests that should have been excluded because they represented invalid tests (e.g. precondition failures). 
* Fixed issue where EiffelStudio would fail while trying to generate tests for a generic type whose generic derivation doesn't exist in the system.
* Fixed a failure of EiffelStudio when trying to display the help of a compiler error.
