[[Property:title|Toolbar customization]]
[[Property:weight|2]]
It is possible to choose which icons appear in the [[Main toolbars|standard toolbar]]  and in the [[Main toolbars|project toolbar]] . To customize the standard toolbar, select '''Customize standard toolbar...''' in the '''Toolbars''' sub-menu of the '''View''' menu. To customize the project toolbar, select '''Customize project toolbar...''' in the same sub-menu. 
In both cases, a toolbar customization window will appear. Two lists of icons are displayed in the window. The list on the right shows the icons that are in the toolbar. The list on the left gathers the icons that are currently not in the toolbar and that may be added. It also contains a separator that may be used to organize icons.

To add an icon or a separator to the toolbar, select it in the left list and click on the '''Add ->''' button. It will then be inserted in the right list after the selected item. <br/>
To remove an icon, click on it in the right list and click on '''<- Remove'''. 

The order of the icons in the right list is the same as in the toolbar. If you want to move an icon in the list, select it and use '''Up''' and '''Down''' buttons. '''Up''' will move it to the top, i.e. to the left of the toolbar. '''Down''' will move it in the opposite direction. 

{{tip| '''Tip''': You can also pick-and-drop icons to organize them. }}

Lastly, some icons can be displayed with an explanatory text. A menu at the bottom of the window will allow you to choose if the text should be displayed. The tables below present the list of these icons for both toolbars and what they look like with and without text.

Once you made the changes you wanted, validate them by clicking on '''OK'''. You can also go back to the initial toolbar layout by clicking on '''C ancel'''.
