At the top of a development window, two toolbars are displayed by default. They are separated by [[Main address bar|the address bar]] , which contains class and feature fields and buttons to select the current view. The standard toolbar is above the address bar, the project bar below it: 
<center> [[Image:main-toolbars]]  </center>

You can hide toolbars (or the address bar) by unselecting them in the '''Toolbars''' sub-menu of the '''View''' menu or in the context menu that you can get by right-clicking in the empty space on the right of the bars. If you want them to be displayed again, just select them in the '''Toolbars''' sub-menu of the '''View''' menu. 

In the standard toolbar, you will find buttons to manage [[Browsing tools|tools]]  and windows or that are related to the [[EiffelStudio Editor Introduction|editor]] . <br/>


{{note|For both toolbars, it is possible to choose which buttons are displayed and which ones are not. See the [[Toolbar customization|Toolbars customization page]]  for more information. }}
