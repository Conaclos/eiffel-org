General limitations:
* Watch expression: Agents are not supported (for instance "agent my_function" is not supported").
* The debugger is still not very helpful when the execution is stopped inside an invariant.

Limitations or known bugs for the Classic debugger:
* Evaluating <code>Precursor</code> will produce the current feature's <code>Result</code> (not the precursor)
* If you use any of the previous non supported expressions in a breakpoint condition, since the evaluation is failing the condition will always return True. In such case the debugger will stop.

Limitations or known bugs for the .Net debugger:
* It happens the debugger does not show the correct executed line, especially when dealing with disabled assertions or disabled debug clauses.
* The same trouble occurs when stepping through an unordered inspect code.

Various known issues for classic system :
* If a precondition is violated inside a rescue, the debugger reports the assertion violation will the exception's tag.
* If you use the "Disable Assertion Handling" functionality when the execution is stopped in a rescue, the effect might be cancelled as soon as the execution exits the rescue's associated feature.
