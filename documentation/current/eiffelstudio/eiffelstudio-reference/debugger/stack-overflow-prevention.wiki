[[Property:title|Stack overflow prevention]]
[[Property:weight|-6]]
Accessible via the '''Debug/Overflow prevention...''' menu, this command makes it possible to detect stack overflows before they occur. Selecting it pops up a dialog that lets you decide at which call stack depth a warning should be issued. 

[[Image:stack-overflow-dlg]]  

By default a warning is issued when the debugged program reaches a stack depth of 1,000 elements.

{{note| '''Note''': Once an application has stopped at the selected level, it will not stop again until its stack depth goes below the critical stack depth again. }}
