[[Property:title|New expression dialog]]
[[Property:weight|2]]
Adding new expressions to the [[Evaluation tool or Watch tool|list of expressions]]  that should be dynamically evaluated is performed via a dialog. 

<center>
{| 
|- 
|   [[Image:new-expression-definition-dlg]]  <br/>
context: Current feature 
|   [[Image:new-expression-as-object-definition-dlg]]  <br/>
context: As object 
|}
</center>

The first part in the dialog makes it possible to select the context of the expression. 
*  The default context is the context of the [[Information relative to a stack element|currently selected call stack element]] . This context gives access to the locals, the arguments, the result and the enclosing object features. <br/>

*  The object context, that requires a valid object address, gives access to the features of the selected object. But if the "As object" is selected, the result of the expression, is the pointed object it self; and you can name the object (see the second screenshot). 
*  The last context, the class-related context, gives access to the once and constants features of that class. It requires a valid class name. 


The second part prompts for the expression itself. This field supports arguments, dot calls and operators (to a certain extent), but does not support creation expressions, agents or static calls (as in "feature {<eiffel>MY_CLASS</eiffel>}.<eiffel>my_feature</eiffel>"). Genericity is partially supported. Despite these limitations, we believe the expression evaluation tool should provide you with a lot of useful functionality.

And the "Keep Assertion Checking" checkbox is used to enable assertion checking during expression evaluation if wanted (by default assertions won't be checked).
