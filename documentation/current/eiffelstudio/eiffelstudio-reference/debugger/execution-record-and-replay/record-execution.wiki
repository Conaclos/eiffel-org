For performance reason, the recording mechanism has a few parameters. For now there is no way to change them easily with the graphical debugger, however you can change those parameters by editing (and recompiling) <code>{RT_DBG_EXECUTION_PARAMETERS}.make</code>. 
* <code>{RT_DBG_EXECUTION_PARAMETERS}.maximum_record_count</code>
** Type: <code>INTEGER</code>
** Default value: 1_000_000
** Effect: The recording keeps only the last <code>maximum_record_count</code> object's records.
* boolean parameter: <code>{RT_DBG_EXECUTION_PARAMETERS}.flatten_when_closing</code> (default: True): when leaving a feature, the recorder can flatten the associated record. This will save memory space, and optimize underlying mechanism. By default it is enabled (and recommended).
* boolean parameter: <code>{RT_DBG_EXECUTION_PARAMETERS}.keep_calls_records</code>(default: True): when flattening call records' values, keep the sub-call records (i.e: the execution calls history)
* boolean parameter: <code>{RT_DBG_EXECUTION_PARAMETERS}.recording_values</code>(default: True): during execution, record attribute and locals assignment (if you just want to review the calls history, you can discard value recording to speed up the recording.)

{{warning|Since there is no way to restore local values when the execution left the related call stack frame, the recording discards the recorded local values.}}


The recording functionality is graphically available on the Call stack tool, or though the "Execution" menu (formerly the "Debug" menu). 

After you start debugging, if at some point you decide to start recording, click on the "record" button:

{{note|If you want to record from the beginning, just enable the recording before starting the debug session (the recording button is a toggle button)}}


{{tip|You can also use the "When hits.." actions of [[Breakpoint editing|breakpoints]]  to start and stop the execution recording. This can be useful to record only the part of an execution that you are interested in.}}

The execution is now recorded. Whenever the application is stopped, you can decide to [[Replay (recorded) execution|replay]] the previously recorded execution. See: [[Replay (recorded) execution]] to learn how to replay an execution.


{{note|EiffelStudio provides record and replay only in classic mode. So, it is not yet supported for .NET systems.}}
