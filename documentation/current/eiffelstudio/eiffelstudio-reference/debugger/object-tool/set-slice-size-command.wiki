Located in the object tool toolbar, this command  [[Image:debugger-set-sizes-icon]]  changes the display size of special objects (i.e. objects whose class is [[ref:/libraries/base/reference/special_chart]] ).Since special objects may contain thousands of attributes, only the first fifty are displayed by default. If left-clicked, a dialog is popped up that sets the exploration indices of special objects that will be loaded in the future. <br/>
This popup also shows the "Maximum displayed string size" in the grid ([[Objects tool: Introduction|objects tool]] , or the [[Expression evaluation|watch tools]] ). 

This dialog changes the settings for future special objects:

[[Image:set-default-slice-size-dlg]]  

If a special object is [[Pick-and-drop mechanism|dropped]]  onto this command, the special object that is dropped is shrunk or extended in the tree according to the new exploration indices it is given in the dialog box. The dropped object may be any object, top-level or not. 

This dialog changes the settings for a single special object (the dropped object) : 

[[Image:set-slice-size-dlg]]
