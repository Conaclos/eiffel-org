* '''Object browse''': browse the object, as you would do in objects or watch tools
* '''Object internal''': display a few internal data such as <code>class_name</code>, <code>type_name</code>, <code>dynamic_type</code>, <code>field_count</code>, <code>deep_physicial_size</code>, and <code>physical_size</code>
