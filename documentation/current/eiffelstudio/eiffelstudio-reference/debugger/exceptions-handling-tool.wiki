[[Property:title|Exceptions handling tool]]
[[Property:weight|-7]]
This tool is used to precise whether the debugger stops or continues on specific exceptions.<br/>
To show this tool, go to menu : '''Debug > Exception handling''' .<br/>
Note: now that exception are object in Eiffel too, the mechanism is unified for classic and dotnet system using the Eiffel exception class names. 

==Exception handling dialog==

If the "filter exceptions" is enabled, for each exception you can leave the exception action as '''Disabled''' (default behavior: catch), '''Catch''' (stop on such exception), '''Ignore''' (do not stop on such exception). By double clicking on the exception name you toggle Ignore/Catch.

In the following picture, we stop on every exception except the "External Exception".

{{tip|Using the "Pattern" field, you can add you own filter using regular expression.}}


==Cat call detection during the execution==

This dialog also provides a way to disable/enable the cat call warning on the console or in the debugger with the first two checkbox fields.
