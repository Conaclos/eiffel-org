While working on a project, you may want to launch it with one or more arguments.

There are two ways to specify arguments for a program from EiffelStudio:
* From the '''Execution, Execution parameters''' menu.
* By right-clicking any of the buttons on the debugging toolbar.

See the [[Execution profiles|Execution parameters dialog]] for more details.
