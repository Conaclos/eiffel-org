[[Property:title|Run with arguments]]
[[Property:weight|-14]]
While working on a project, you may want to launch it with one or more arguments.

There are two ways to specify arguments for a program from EiffelStudio:
* From the '''Debug, Debugging Options''' menu.
* By right-clicking any of the buttons on the debugging toolbar.

==Using the Argument Dialog==

[[Image:argument-dialog]]  



The dialog allows you to manage different execution profiles to specify parameters to be passed to the system at execution time. 

Each profile allows to set a title, the '''arguments''', the '''working directory''', and you can also set your own '''environment variables'''.

To use a profile, just select it by clicking the corresponding line in the grid..

Once the appropriate execution profile is selected then the system can be run with those parameters using the Run button (If "Keep Dialog Open" is selected the dialog remains opened).<br/>
To run without any particular parameter select '''default''' 's profile.

If you click on "Run Workbench" or "Run Finalized", the system will be executed outside EiffelStudio (thus no debugging)..
