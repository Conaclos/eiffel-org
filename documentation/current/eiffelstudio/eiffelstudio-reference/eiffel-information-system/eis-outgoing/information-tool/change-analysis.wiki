Within EiffelStudio 7.3, there will be new functions in Infomation tool to track changes on target or external resouce side, and potentially affected items on either side are listed.
* New functions are:
** List of elements of current system that would be affected by external resource changes. (External resource is limited to local files.)
** List of external resources that might be affected by changes of current system. (No limit of the type of external resources)
** Change acknowledgement.

Typical work flow to demo affected external resources caused by current system change:
# Open a class, add an Information entry with an external source in the class.
# Start working on that class, save it at as you normally do on regular basis.
# Open Info tool, go to Affected source item in the left tree.
# Check the list of external resouces that might be affected by last changes, as shown in the sceen cast bellow.
# Acknowledge the changes if you find that the external resources do not need a change for last changes of current system.

Typical work flow to demo affected items in the system caused by external resource change:
# Open a class, add an Information entry with an external document (limited to local files in 7.3) in the class.
# Start working on that document, save it at as you normally do on regular basis.
# Open Info tool, go to Affected target in the left tree.
# Check the list of targets that might be affected by last changes of the document. (You may need to click on the "sweep the system now." button to get a full list if auto-sweeping is not enabled.)
# Acknowledge the changes if you find that current system does not need a change for last changes of the document.
