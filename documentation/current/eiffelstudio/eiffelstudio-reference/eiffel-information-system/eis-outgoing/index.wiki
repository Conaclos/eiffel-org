==Annotations==

Annotations for outgoing EIS links may be applicable to:
*  An individual class or feature. In this case the annotation appears in the class text, as part of an Eiffel <code>note</code> clause (the obsolete keyword <code>indexing</code> may still be supported, depending upon which syntax level is chosen in project preferences).
*  A target, library or cluster. In this case the annotation appears in the associated ECF file; EiffelStudio provides support for entering it through a Information (EIS) Tool.

To specify a link between Eiffel and external information, you include such an annotation. 

The primary components of an annotation are: 
#  The '''EIS''' marker. 
#  The '''[[Protocols|protocol]]''', which indicates the type of external information, and making it possible for EIS to determine the associated external tool. If the '''protocol''' is omitted, its value defaults to "Raw URL".
#  The '''source'''. This is the location of the external information, for example a URL, or a file name. 

==Syntax for Annotations==

Annotations can occur in Eiffel source code and in project configuration files (.ecf). The format of the '''EIS marker''' varies depending upon the context in which it is used. The rest of the annotation format is the same in both contexts.

The following example illustrates the form of an EIS annotation written in Eiffel source code. The annotation appears in the <code>note</code> part of a class or feature definition:
<code lang="text">
EIS: "name=Project Requirement", "src=($PROJ)/docs/requirements.pdf", "protocol=PDF", "nameddest=4.1", "tag=requirement"
</code>

The '''EIS marker''' is the label '''EIS:''' (this label is called the ''Note_name'' in the ISO/ECMA Eiffel Standard syntax). The '''EIS marker''' tells the Eiffel Information System that this particular ''Note_entry'' is of interest to EIS. In this example, the file name (src) includes '''$PROJ''', referring to a variable, defining the project location. 

The '''name''' property assigns a name to this annotation. The name will be visible in the [[Information Tool]].

The '''protocol''' is '''PDF'''. 

The '''nameddest''' property (name destination) is a specific property of PDF documents that tells the external tool for PDF documents to open the document at a particular named destination. 

The '''tag''' property associates a text tag, in this case "requirement" with this link. Tags show up in the [[Information Tool]] and can be used to organize annotations. 

The following is an example of an annotation  Eiffel configuration (.ecf) file: 

<code lang="text">
<note ise_support="EIS" protocol="pdf" name="Project Requirement" src="($PROJ)/docs/requirements.pdf" nameddest="4.1"/></code>

The one major difference here is the form of the '''EIS marker'''. Here it appears in an XML attribute. '''ise_support="EIS"''' plays the same role as '''EIS:''' does in the <code>note</code> entry example above. '''ise_support''' tells the parser this <code lang="text"><note/></code> element is of interest to Eiffel Software specific tools. The <code lang="text">note</code> element in Eiffel configuration files is supported in ECF schema version 1.4.
