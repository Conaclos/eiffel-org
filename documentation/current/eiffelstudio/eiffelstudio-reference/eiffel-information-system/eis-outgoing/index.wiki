==Annotations==

Annotations may be applicable to:
*  An individual class or feature. In this case the annotation appears in the class text, as part of an Eiffel <code>note</code> clause (the obsolete keyword <code>indexing</code> may still be supported, depending upon which syntax level is chosen in project preferences).
*  A target, library or cluster. In this case the annotation appears in the associated ECF file; EiffelStudio provides support for entering it through a Information (EIS) Tool.

The basic way to specify a dependency is to include such an annotation. The required part of an annotation is:
*  The "EIS" marker

However the following parts are suggested:
*  The "protocol", indicating the type of external information, and making it possible for EIS to determine the associated external tool. If the "protocol" part is omitted, the source defaults to be web page.
*  The source, identification of where to find information itself, for example a URL, or a file name. 

==Syntax for Annotations==

The following example illustrates the basic form of an EIS note entry:
<code lang="text">
EIS: "name=Project Requirement", "src=($PROJ)/docs/requirements.pdf", "protocol=PDF", "nameddest=4.1", "tag=requirement"
</code>

The label (or Note_name as it is called in the ECMA/ISO Eiffel Standard syntax) is '''EIS:'''. The '''EIS:''' Note_name tells the Eiffel Information System that this Note_entry is of interest to EIS, as distinct from any other information that might be expressed through a Note_entry. In this example, the file name (src) includes '''$PROJ''', referring to a variable, defining the project location. The protocol is PDF. The '''nameddest''' property (name destination) is a specific property of PDF documents. The tag '''requirement''' indicating that this entry links the enclosing Eiffel class or feature with some parts of the requirement documents.


Similarly, the following example demonstrates how annotations look like in ECF files: 

<code lang="text">
<note ise_support="EIS" protocol="pdf" name="Project Requirement" src="($PROJ)/docs/requirements.pdf" nameddest="4.1"/></code>


There is only one major difference here - the attribute '''ise_support'''. '''ise_support="EIS"''' takes place of Note_name '''EIS:'''. '''EIS''' plays the same role as it does in a <code>note</code> entry. '''ise_support''' tells the parser this note element is of interest to tools from ISE rather than other third-party ones. The note element in ECF is supported in [schema 1.4].
