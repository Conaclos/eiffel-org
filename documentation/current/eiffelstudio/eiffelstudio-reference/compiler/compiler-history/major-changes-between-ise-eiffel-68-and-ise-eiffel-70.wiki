==What's new==
* Supported development of incomplete void-safe classes (so called "design mode") by avoiding reporting void-safety errors for unreachable code, e.g. for the code after a call to a feature that never returns normally, say, to <e>{EXCEPTIONS}.die</e>. As a result it became possible to declare a creation procedure that does not initialize attached attributes properly (because the corresponding effective classes are not available yet), for example:
<e>
make (...)
	do
		... -- Some attributes are not initialized.
		die (1) -- Compiler does not report VEVI errors.
	end
</e>
:or
<e>
make (...)
	do
		... -- Some attributes are not initialized.
		check implemented: False then end -- Compiler does not report VEVI errors.
	end
</e>

==Improvements==
* Enforced full class checking for void-safe classes.
* Disallowed void-safety mismatch when a descendant or a client have stricter void-safety setting than the corresponding ancestor or supplier.
* Taken into account changes of class options when performing recompilation.
* Changed processing of "stable" features to follow the recent modifications to the standard.
* Avoided reporting errors related to variable initialization when the right-hand part of assignment to this variable causes an error.
* Promoted keywords <e>across</e> and <e>some</e> from provisional syntax to the standard one.
* Made class <e>BIT_REF</e> optional as soon as a <e>BIT</e> type is not used in a system (to be ready to drop support for <e>BIT</e> types in the next releases).
* Replaced keyword completion for <e>indexing</e> with keyword completion for <e>note</e>.

==Changes==
* Changed default options: default [[Setting the syntax variant|syntax]] is set to [[Syntax level variant settings by version|standard]], [[Void-safety: Background, definition, and tools#Types as "attached" or "detachable"|attached-by-default]] is set to '''true''' unless specified otherwise.
* Moved [[Void-safety: Background, definition, and tools#Types as "attached" or "detachable"|attached-by-default]] option to [[Advanced Options|Advanced]] section.
