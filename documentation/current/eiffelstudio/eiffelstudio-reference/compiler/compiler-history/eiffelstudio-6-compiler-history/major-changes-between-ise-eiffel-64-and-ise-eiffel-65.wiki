===Runtime/code generation issues===
* Fixed bug#13969 where an Eiffel generated DLL trying to print something to the console would cause a crash
* Fixed bug#15553 where querying <eiffel>{FILE}.is_socket</eiffel> and some other file properties would not work properly on some Unix platforms (Solaris in particular).
* Fixed bug#13852 and bug#13816 where allocating large arrays would cause a memory corruption.
* Improved runtime protection of certain routines if a signal is delivered to avoid either corruption or memory leak (Fixes bug#13851, bug#13842, bug#13849, bug#13850 and bug#13840).
