=Introduction=

The command line utility finish_freezing is used to compile external code generated by the Eiffel compiler. Most of the time finish_freezing gets executed behind the scenes as you freeze and finalize Eiffel systems, so you don't really need to be aware of it. However, finish_freezing can be run standalone, and is useful, for example, when porting systems to other platforms.

=Usage of finish_freezing=

<code lang="text">
finish_freezing [-location <directory>] [-generate_only] [-nproc <n>] [-low]
[-x86] [-silent [-silent...]] [-library [-library...]] [-version] [-nologo]
</code>
