[[Property:title|Metric History Panel]]
[[Property:weight|3]]
The metric history panel lists all recorded metric evaluations. You can select them and reevaluate them to see the new value and if it differs from the old result.

Lets have a look at the buttons in the main toolbar highlighted in the following figure:

==Recalculate Metric History==

To recalculate a metric history, you need to selected those items that you want to recalculate. In the following figure, a metric history item '''Uncommented features''' is selected.

[[Image:interface17|Select metric history]]  

After recalculating the selected metric history items, the result will be highlighted, as shown in the following figure:

[[Image:interface18|History recalculationg result]]  

In the above figure, the row '''Uncommented features''' is highlighted indicating that this item has been recalculated. And from the row, we can see that the current value is 1 while the previous value is 0, meaning that there is one uncommented feature in cluster sample now while there was no uncommented feature in cluster sample when this metric was calculated the last time.

==Metric History Warning Checking==

Another thing you can do in metric history is to assign a warning tester to each item. When the metric history is recalculated with metric history warning checking enabled, the warning tester will be evaluated against the metric value to see if it's condition is satisfied.

Let's use an example to demonstrate the idea. Suppose we have set up a metric history warning shown in the following two figures:

[[Image:interface20|warning tester]]  

[[Image:interface19|warning tester]]  

This warning means, when the metric '''Uncommented features''' is calculated over the input domain {sample}, the value should be zero, otherwise a warning should be emitted.

After recalculating the metric history item, we get the following result:

[[Image:interface21|warning tester]]  

From the above result, we can see that the value of the metric '''Uncommented features''' over the input domain {sample} is 1 while our warning says it should be 0. So we get a warning message.
