Several EiffelStudio facilities log their progress to the various panes of the '''Outputs tool'''. 

You can view the outputs from different facilities by selecting the name of a pane from the '''Output:''' drop-down list, as shown below.

The output panes you see listed depend somewhat upon how you've been using EiffelStudio. For example, if during a session you edit and compile a project but never run it, you would not see the Debugger output pane. Then after you had run the system, the Debugger output pane would join the list.
