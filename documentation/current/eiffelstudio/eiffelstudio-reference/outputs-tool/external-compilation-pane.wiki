==Introduction==

During the majority of ordinary development projects in Eiffel, it may be rare for programmers to need to know what's going on with the external compilation that occurs during freezing and finalization steps. However, during the development of some types of systems, particularly those that involve interfaces to non-Eiffel components, it is helpful to monitor the external compilation.

The external compilation pane shows a log of the compilation output from the external (typically C language) compiler. But the external compilation pane is more than just a log. It has powerful features that help you deal with the results of external compilation.

==Selecting your locale==

If the external compiler uses a different locale than your default locale, you can select your particular locale in the "Locale" box.

==Open a file mentioned in the external compilation output==

You can open a file mentioned in the external compiler output in a specified external editor by selecting the file name and then clicking the '''send to external editor''' ( [[Image:metrics-tool--command-send-to-external-editor-icon|send to external editor]] ) button, shown in the bottom bar of the following figure:

==View external code for a class/feature==

You can view the external code for a particular Eiffel class or feature in an external editor. Pick the class or feature whose generated code you want to see, and drop it onto the [[Image:metrics-tool--command-send-to-external-editor-icon|send to external editor]] button. The external code for the class or feature will be shown in an external editor. 

The figure below shows an example of picking the feature <code>make</code> and dropping it on the '''send to external editor''' button.

===View external code from the finalized folder===

By default the code that you see in an external editor is from the workbench (W_code) folder. You can see the corresponding external code from the finalized (F_code) folder by holding the <code>CTRL</code> key while you drop the class or feature pebble.
