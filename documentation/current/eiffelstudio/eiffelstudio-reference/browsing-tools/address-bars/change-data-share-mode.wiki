Located in the '''View''' menu, named either '''Link context tool''' or '''Unlink context tool''', this command allows you to switch between the two possible [[Address bars: Introduction|addressing modes]] . It is also accessible through the main toolbar (  [[Image:context-link-icon]] ). 

{{note| '''Note''': This command only applies to the development window where it is invoked, and this setting is not automatically saved when exiting EiffelStudio. }}
