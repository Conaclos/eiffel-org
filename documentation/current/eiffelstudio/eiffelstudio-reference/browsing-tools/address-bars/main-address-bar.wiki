[[Property:weight|1]]
The main address bar is located in the top part of windows, between the two [[Main toolbars|main toolbars]]  (when they are displayed). 

[[Image:main-address-bar]]  

It has several components:
* History back and forth arrows  [[Image:view-previous-icon]]  and  [[Image:view-next-icon]]  
* Fields where the current class or feature name is displayed
* View icons to change the view displayed in the editor  [[Image:view-editor-icon]] ,  [[Image:view-clickable-icon]] ,  [[Image:view-flat-icon]] ,  [[Image:view-contracts-icon]]  and  [[Image:view-flat-contracts-icon]]  

It is possible to type a class or feature name to center the editor on it. Typing a class name that does not exist in the set of known classes pops up a dialog to create a class of that name.

{{tip| '''Tip''': Wildcards (* and ?) are available in these fields. }}
