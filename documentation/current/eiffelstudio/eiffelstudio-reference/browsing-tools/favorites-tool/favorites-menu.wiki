The '''favorites''' menu is composed of two parts. 

First, there are three commands:
* The '''Add to Favorites''' command, that adds the currently edited class to the root of the favorites tree. 
* The '''Show/Hide Favorites''' command, that shows or hides the [[Favorites tree|favorites tree]] . 
* The '''Organize Favorites''' command, that displays the [[Organize favorites dialog: Introduction|Organize Favorites dialog]] . 

After the separator, the favorites are displayed in a menu representation. Clicking on any of these menu items will send the selected favorite class to the editor.
