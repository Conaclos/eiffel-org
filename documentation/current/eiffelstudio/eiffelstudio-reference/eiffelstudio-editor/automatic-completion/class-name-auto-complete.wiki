==Overview==
The EiffelStudio editor will complete class names automatically. This means, for example, when you type in the editor pane:
<code>
    a_variable_name: LI</code>
and then triggers the auto-complete, one of two things will happen:
* If there is only one class name in the universe that begins `<code>LI</code>', then that class name will be automatically placed in the editor pane at the cursor.
* If there is more than one such class name, the editor will propose a list of possible valid class names, as seen in Figure 1. 

Auto-completion can be triggered by pressing <code>Ctrl+Shift+Space</code> or by following the [[Edit menu commands|edit menu]] path:
<code lang="text">
Edit --> Advanced --> Complete Class Name
</code>
<br/>

==The class auto-completion window==
The class auto-completion window will pop up and display the list of class names which begin with the string `<code>LI</code>'. So, you can imaging the auto-completion as a search for class names using the characters you type followed by a wild card character (*). The first item of the list will be selected. You can select a class name from the list by double-clicking a name in the list or by using the keyboard <code>Up</code> and <code>Down</code> buttons to navigate the list, then pressing <code>Enter</code> to select a highlighted class name. The auto-completion window can be cancelled by clicking outside the window or pressing <code>Esc</code>.
