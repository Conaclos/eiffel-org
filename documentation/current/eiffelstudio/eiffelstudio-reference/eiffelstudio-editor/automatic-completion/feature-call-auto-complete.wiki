==Overview==

EiffelStudio editor provides automatic help for completing feature calls. 

With the default EiffelStudio preferences, feature call auto-completion occurs automatically when you type a dot ('.') character after a feature name.

This means, for example, that in the Editor pane when you type:
<code>
            my_string.</code> 
the editor will propose a list of possible valid feature names from which to choose, as seen in Figure 1.

Feature call auto-completion can also be triggered:

# By pressing <code>crtl+space</code> 
# By following the edit menu path:

<code lang="text">
Edit --> Advanced --> Complete word
</code>


Feature call auto-completion is most commonly used in the Editor pane. But the same functionality is also available elsewhere in EiffelStudio, for example:

* Expressions in the editable grid of the Watch tool.
* "Expression" in the New Expression dialog of the Watch tool.
* "Condition" in the Breakpoints dialog


==The feature call auto-completion window==

Using the example above, when auto-completion is triggered, the feature call auto-completion window will pop up and display a list of feature names which can be applied in the current context.

When the auto-completion window appears, the first item in the list, if any, will be selected. To complete your code with the selected item, press "Enter" or "Ctrl+Space". To choose another item, use keyboard Up and Down arrows or the mouse. 

You can also continue typing characters and the list will automatically be narrowed provided that you have non-matching entries filtered out (see [[#Auto-completion list display options|Auto-completion list display options]] below). To validate your choice, press "Enter" or "Ctrl+Space". If there is no selected item, the content of the text field will be inserted. 


To cancel the auto-complete, press "Esc" at any time. 

==Auto-complete list display options==

At the bottom of the auto-completion window you will find a row of icons labeled "Options:". These options help you control which choices are presented to you and the format of their presentation. The options are described in the [[Class name auto complete#Auto-completion list display options|section on class name auto-completion]].


{{tip|The following tips can help you get the most out of feature call automatic completion: }}
* If the selected feature is a query, you can call the auto-complete again right after the previous completion. There is no need to type a dot.
* You can call the auto-complete without an identifier. The auto-complete window will then show the features of the current class.
* The keyboard shortcut for automatic completion can be changed in the [[Keyboard shortcuts preferences|editor preferences]] . 
* Typing a non-alphanumeric character in the completion window automatically closes it. You can therefore type '.', ' ' or '(' to close the completion window and start typing the next token straight away.

{{note|There are just a few more things you should know about feature call automatic completion: }}
* Only identifiers that were already defined when the class was compiled for the last time can be completed, except for local entity names that can always be completed.
* Only compiled features will appear in the auto-complete window.
* By default, features from class ANY will be ignored by the auto-complete window. This can be changed in the [[General Editor Preferences|editor preferences]] .
