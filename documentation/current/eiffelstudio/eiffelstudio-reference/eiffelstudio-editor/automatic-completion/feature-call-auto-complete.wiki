==Overview==

EiffelStudio editor provides automatic help for completing feature calls. 

This means, for example, that in the Editor pane when you type:
<code>
            an_string.a</code> 
and then trigger feature call auto-completion, one of two things will happen:
# If there is only one available feature name that begins with "<code>a</code>", then a template for a call to that feature will be inserted into the code.
# If more than one such feature name exists, the editor will propose a list of possible valid feature names from which to choose, as seen in Figure 1.

Feature call auto-completion can be triggered:

# Automatically as soon as you type a dot ('.') after a feature name
# By pressing <code>crtl+space</code> 
# By following the edit menu path:

<code lang="text">
Edit --> Advanced --> Complete word
</code>


Feature call auto-completion is most commonly used in the Editor pane. But the same functionality is also available elsewhere in EiffelStudio, for example:

* Expressions in the editable grid of the Watch tool.
* "Expression" in the New Expression dialog of the Watch tool.
* "Condition" in the Breakpoints dialog


==The feature call auto-completion window==

Using the example above, when auto-completion is triggered, the feature call auto-completion window will pop up and display a list of feature names which begin with the string "<code>a</code>". So, you can think of the auto-completion as a search for feature names using the characters you

Figure 1. The feature auto-completion window.


This window will contain a text field and a list. The text field will be filled with the beginning of the feature name that was entered. The first item in the list, if any, will be selected. <br/>
To complete your code with the selected item, press "Enter" or "Ctrl+Space". <br/>
To choose another item, use keyboard Up and Down arrows or the mouse. You can also modify the content of the text field. The list will be updated automatically. To validate your choice, press "Enter" or "Ctrl+Space". If there is no selected item, the content of the text field will be inserted. <br/>
To cancel the auto-complete, press "Esc" at any time. 

{{tip|The following tips can help you get the most out of feature call automatic completion: }}
* If the selected feature is a query, you can call the auto-complete again right after the previous completion. There is no need to type a dot.
* You can call the auto-complete without an identifier. The auto-complete window will then show the features of the current class.
* The keyboard shortcut for automatic completion can be changed in the [[Keyboard shortcuts preferences|editor preferences]] . 
* Typing a non-alphanumeric character in the completion window automatically closes it. You can therefore type '.', ' ' or '(' to close the completion window and start typing the next token straight away.

{{note|There are just a few more things you should know about feature call automatic completion: }}
* Only identifiers that were already defined when the class was compiled for the last time can be completed, except for local entity names that can always be completed.
* Only compiled features will appear in the auto-complete window.
* By default, features from class ANY will be ignored by the auto-complete window. This can be changed in the [[General Editor Preferences|editor preferences]] .
