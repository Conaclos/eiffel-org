==Introduction==

The Eiffel Testing Framework is a facility within EiffelStudio that helps developers create, manage, and execute software tests. These pages are intended to describe the Eiffel Testing Framework interface and capabilities. In addition to this material, you will find a tutorial entitled [[Using the Eiffel Testing Framework]] in [[EiffelStudio: A Guided Tour]]. The tutorial includes a simple example that you can use to work through the Testing Frameworks different facilities. It also contains definitions for terminology used in the tutorial and in this reference. Specifically:

#[[Testing: Background and basics#Test classes and tests|Test classes and tests]]
#[[Testing: Background and basics#Types of tests|The types of test supported by the Eiffel Testing Framework]]
#[[Testing: Background and basics#Anatomy of a test|Target classes and target routines]]
#[[Execute tests#About test results|Test results]]


==Components==

When you use the Eiffel Testing Framework, you control things by using two components: the '''interface''' and the '''New Eiffel test wizard'''. The interface is used to access, manage, execute, and monitor tests. The New Eiffel test wizard is used to help you create new tests.

===The interface===

The interface consists of four primary components: 
# The toolbar
# The view filtering controls 
# The tests view
# The tabbed status and results reporting pane

====Toolbar====

The toolbar allows you to create new tests using the '''[[#The New Eiffel test wizard|New Eiffel test wizard]]''' and to run existing tests.

The '''Create new tests''' command ( [[Image:Create new tests]] ) invokes the '''New Eiffel test wizard'''.

The '''Run all tests in background''' command ( [[Image:debug-run-icon]] ) will, by default, run all tests. But if only certain tests are selected in the '''Tests''' list, then '''Run all tests in background''' will run only those tests. The '''Run all tests in background''' allows other options for running tests through its drop-down icon ( [[Image:toolbar-dropdown-icon]] ).

The '''Debug all tests in EiffelStudio''' command ( [[Image:Testing Framework debug all icon]] ) functions in a similar manner to '''Run all tests in background''' with the exception that each test is paused at its starting point in the EiffelStudio debugger. '''Debug all tests in EiffelStudio''' has a drop-down icon providing the same options as '''Run all tests in background'''.

The '''Stop all execution''' command ( [[Image:debug-stop-icon]] ) will halt all tests which were started by the '''Run all tests in background''' or '''Debug all tests in EiffelStudio''' commands.


====View Filtering====

{{note|The development of this section is on hold pending interface changes. }}


====Tests====

The Tests pane presents tests in one or more expandable tree views. The structures of the trees depend upon the criteria that you have specified for organizing the view. For example, if you look at tests based on the test classes in which they exist, the roots of the tree views will reflect the clusters in which the test classes exist. 

Likewise, if you look at tests based on their target classes, the roots will be the clusters that include the target classes.

Tests and test classes are pickable in the Tests pane.
