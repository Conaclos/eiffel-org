==Introduction==

The Eiffel Testing Framework is a facility within EiffelStudio that helps developers create, manage, and execute software tests. These pages are intended to describe the Eiffel Testing Framework interface and capabilities. In addition to this material, you will find a tutorial entitled [[Using the Eiffel Testing Framework]] in [[EiffelStudio: A Guided Tour]]. The tutorial includes a simple example that you can use to work through the Testing Frameworks different facilities. It also contains definitions for terminology used in the tutorial and in this reference. Specifically:

#[[Testing: Background and basics#Test classes and tests|Test classes and tests]]
#[[Testing: Background and basics#Types of tests|The types of test supported by the Eiffel Testing Framework]]
#[[Testing: Background and basics#Anatomy of a test|Target classes and target routines]]
#[[Execute tests#About test results|Test results]]


==Components==

When you use the Eiffel Testing Framework, you control things by using two components: '''[[The Eiffel Testing Framework Interface]]''' and '''[[The New Eiffel Test Wizard]]'''. The interface is used to access, manage, execute, and monitor tests. The New Eiffel test wizard is used to help you create new tests.
