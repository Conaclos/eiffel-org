==Introduction==

The '''New Eiffel test wizard''' creates new tests based on information a developer enters on a series of forms. There is a different thread through these forms corresponding to each of the three test types supported by the Eiffel Testing Framework. 

The '''New Eiffel test wizard''' is invoked by clicking the '''Create new tests''' button ( [[Image:create new tests]] ) on the Eiffel Testing Framework interface toolbar. 



==The "New Eiffel test wizard" pane==

The first pane of the wizard allows you to choose which type of test(s) you wish to create.

==The manual test thread==

Creating manual tests will involve using the following wizard panes. For a guided tour of this process, see [[Create a manual test]].


===The "New test class" pane===


In this pane you provide a name and cluster for the test class that will be created. You can also indicate that the created class include redefined versions of features <eiffel>on_prepare</eiffel> (called during preparation for test execution) and <eiffel>on_clean</eiffel> (called during clean-up after test execution).
