==Introduction==


{{note| '''To users of V6.6 and later:''' As of V6.6, the New Eiffel test wizard panes have changed somewhat from this documentation. V6.6 introduces the ability to store certain preferred values for creating tests. The advantage is that one need not enter this information on wizard panes each time a test is created. Because preferred values can be stored, the panes containing the values more likely to change between test creations are presented earlier than other panes. In previous versions, these panes were presented later, as shown in this documentation. The documentation will be updated in the future to reflect the newer wizard sequences and pane layouts. }}


The '''New Eiffel test wizard''' creates new tests based on information entered by a developer on a series of wizard panes. Each of the three test types supported by AutoTest requires certain unique information. Therefore, there is a unique sequence of wizard panes corresponding to each test type. 

The '''New Eiffel test wizard''' is invoked by clicking the '''Create new tests''' button ( [[Image:create new tests]] ) on the AutoTest interface toolbar. 



==The "New Eiffel test wizard" pane==

The first pane of the wizard allows you to choose which type of test(s) you wish to create.

==The manual test wizard sequence==


Creating manual tests will involve using the following wizard panes. For a guided tour of this process, see [[Create a manual test]].


===The "New test class" pane===


In this pane you provide a name and cluster for the test class that will be created. You can also indicate that the created class should include redefined versions of features <eiffel>on_prepare</eiffel> (called during preparation for test execution) and/or <eiffel>on_clean</eiffel> (called during clean-up after test execution).

===The "Test routine" pane===

This pane gives you the ability to name the test, and to associate it with certain [[Create a manual test#About Tags|tags]].

For tags, there are two entry boxes with '''Add''' buttons to their right. You can use the top entry box to create entries for a tag system that you have developed. 

On the bottom box, use the drop-down arrow to choose a predefined tag, such as associating the test with a target class and routine.


==The extracted test wizard sequence==


The '''Extract tests from running application''' radio button is only sensitive if the system is currently running. 

Creating extracted tests will involve using the following wizard panes. For a guided tour of this process, see [[Using extracted tests]].


===The "New test class" pane===

For extracted tests, the second pane to appear is the '''New test class''' pane. It is completed just as for manual tests.


===The "Extract application state" pane===

This pane provides a depiction of the current call stack. Choose the routine or routines for which you want extracted tests to be created.


==The generated test wizard sequence==


Creating generated tests will involve using the following wizard panes. For a guided tour of this process, see [[Using generated tests]].


===The "New test class" pane===


[[Image:AutoTest new test wizard 02S 01]]


This pane appears slightly different for generated tests versus manual or extracted tests. The class name is actually a prefix upon which a numeric index will be appended. The index is depicted to the right of the entry box. 


===The "Generate tests through AutoTest" pane===


[[Image:AutoTest new test wizard 03S 01]]


On this pane enter the information needed to produce generated tests. Use the '''Class or type name''' entry box in the lower left, along with the <code>+</code> and <code>-</code> buttons, to declare a list of one or more classes as target classes for generated tests. 

Other information necessary for creating generated tests is:

*'''Cutoff (minutes)''' -- How long AutoTest will execute random invocations of the routines in the classes to be tested, specified in minutes.
*'''Cutoff (invocations)''' -- How long AutoTest will execute random invocations of the routines in the classes to be tested, specified by invocation count.
*'''Routine timeout (seconds)''' -- How long AutoTest will wait for completion of any invocation.
*'''Random number generation seed''' -- The seed used for random number generator used during the process. A value of zero instructs AutoTest to use a seed derived from the system clock.
*'''Use slicing for minimization''' -- Designate '''slicing''' as the approach for minimizing the size of generated tests.
*'''Use ddmin for minimization''' -- Designate '''ddmin''' as the approach for minimizing the size of generated tests.
*'''Create html output''' -- Output history and statistics from the synthesizing process in html format.
