The Eiffel mechanism for interfacing with other languages, as defined by the [[ECMA Standard 367|Eiffel standard (8.31)]] uses a syntax for '''external''' features. 

Additionally, there is a notion of target languages being either '''registered''' or '''unregistered'''. A language is registered if every Eiffel implementation must support the external interface to this language as defined by the standard. So the names of all registered languages appear in the Eiffel standard. And the details of the specific external mechanisms for those languages also appear in the standard. Registered languages included in the June 2006 edition of the standard are '''"C"''', '''"C++"''', and '''"dll"'''.
