All Vision2 primitives inherit [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_primitive_chart|EV_PRIMITIVE]] . 

==What is a primitive?==
A primitive is a Vision2 widget that may not contain other widgets. Primitives may be placed in [[Containers|containers]] , but a [[Widgets|widget ]] may not contain any child widgets. Some examples of primitives are [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_button_chart|EV_BUTTON]]  and [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_label_chart|EV_LABEL]] . 
==Features of a primitive==

All primitives inherit from [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_tooltipable_chart|EV_TOOLTIPABLE]]  and therefore can have tooltips assigned to them. They all inherit many features from [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_widget_chart|EV_WIDGET]] . Each descendent of [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_primitive_chart|EV_PRIMITIVE]]  will typically have many available features, specific to their type. For example, [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_separator_chart|EV_SEPARATOR]]  has no extra features, but [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_label_chart|EV_LABEL]]  has features for modifying the current font and also the text to be displayed. 

==Widgets as item holders==

Although no primitive can contain another widget, certain primitives may contain one or more [[Items|items]] . One example of this is an [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_list_chart| EV_LIST]]  containing [[ref:libraries/vision2/reference/ev_list_item_chart|EV_LIST_ITEM]] s.
