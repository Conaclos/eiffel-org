==EiffelBase Organization==

The EiffelBase library includes:

* A Kernel cluster of core classes used in all Eiffel systems. These include a universal class providing facilities potentially useful for all classes: ANY. Every class is a descendant of this classes. The kernel also defines classes needed for exception handling, standard arithmetic operations, hashable elements for use with hash tables and basic arithmetic conversions.
* A Data Structures cluster provides implementations of fundamental data structures and algorithms: Abstract structures, describing broad categories; lists in their various forms; list elements; circular chains; sorted sets and lists; various trees and binary trees; cursor trees; hash tables (dictionaries); various stacks, queues and priority queues; and more.
* A Support cluster provides helper classes for specific needs. These needs include basic math support, random numbers generation, and a few others such as the list of ASCII constants.
