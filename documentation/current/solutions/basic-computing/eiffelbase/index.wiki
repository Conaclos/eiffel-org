==The EiffelBase Class Library==

The EiffelBase class library, covered by the open-source [[IFELL|IFFEL license]], is one of the principal contributions of Eiffel: a library of fundamental structures and algorithms covering the basics of computing, and resulting from a "Linnaean" effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of computing structures. EiffelBase is one of the most carefully designed and extensively used libraries in the object-oriented industry. 

The pages here will provide you with an overview of the organization, structure and intent of the classes in the library, a link to the class specifications, sample applications using EiffelBase, and the text of the IFELL License.
