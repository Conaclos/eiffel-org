EiffelBase, covered by the open-source [[IFELL|IFFEL license]] , is one of the principal contributions of Eiffel: a library of fundamental structures and algorithms covering the basics of computing, and resulting from a "Linnaean" effort at a general-purpose taxonomy of computing structures. EiffelBase is one of the most carefully designed and extensively used libraries in the object-oriented industry. 

The EiffelBase library includes:
* A [[EiffelBase, The Kernel|Kernel]]  that defines the core classes of all Eiffel systems. 
* A [[EiffelBase Data Structures Overview|Data Structures]]  cluster including classes for all the major data structures (sets, lists, tables etc...) 
* A [[EiffelBase Support Cluster|Support]]  cluster that provide access to the environment, basic math operations and a few other helper classes.
