=Description=

Unlike many of the other examples, this one is not really a problem to be solved. Rather, the Counter example uses multiple instances of the simple class <code>COUNTER</code> to explore various concurrent scenarios. Each instance of <code>COUNTER</code> has a unique identifier, a current value, and a speed. A counter's speed is that time that it takes to perform a single increment. You will see that some of the tests start multiple counters at different speeds. Class <code>COUNTER</code> has a procedure <code>run</code> which takes an integer as an argument, and increments the counter that many times. The example's root class contains the code to create counter instances and run the various tests.
