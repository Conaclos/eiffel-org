=Description=

The [http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sleeping_barber_problem barbershop], sometimes called ''the sleeping barber'', models a barbershop with one barber, one barber's chair, and a waiting room with several chairs. The alternative name of the problem comes from the fact that if there is no one waiting for a haircut, the barber flops in his chair and falls asleep. 

Also involved are a number of shaggy-haired customers. A customer entering the barbershop looks around and assesses the situation. If all the waiting room chairs are occupied, the customer leaves the shop to return again at a time when hopefully the queue will be shorter. If there is an open chair the customer sits down and waits for the barber.

Once the barber has finished cutting a customer's hair, the customer leaves the shop which allows another customer to enter the shop and the the next customer in the queue to get a haircut.
