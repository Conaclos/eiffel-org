The Interface layer gathers a set of classes covering all the capabilities an application need to interface efficiently with a DBMS.

The interface affords these main capabilities:
*  [[Database Connection|Connecting]]  to the database. 
*  [[Data Modification|Modifying]]  database objects. 
*  [[Database Selection|Selecting]]  data from the database. 
*  [[Selection Access|Accessing]]  data selected from the database. 
*  [[Data Object Coupling|Coupling]]  database objects with Eiffel objects. 
*  [[Query variables|Binding variables]]  in a database query. 
* Using [[Stored Procedures|stored procedures]] . 
* Dealing with database [[Database control|status and behavior]] . 

{{note|In general, each of these capabilities corresponds to one EiffelStore class. }}
