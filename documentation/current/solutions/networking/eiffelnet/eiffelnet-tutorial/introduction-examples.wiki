[[Property:title|Introduction to the examples]]
[[Property:weight|4]]
The following sections describe a set of examples showing how to use EiffelNet to build client-server applications.

The examples start with the most simple uses involving high-level classes covering common cases and shielding developers from details of the mechanism. Subsequent examples will reveal some of these details, useful for more advanced or specific applications of EiffelNet.

All the examples discussed here appear in the directory ''$ISE_EIFFEL/examples/net'' of the Eiffel distribution. 

{{warning| '''Caution''': On Windows, the `advanced' and the `same_mach' are not working since they are using specific code to Unix Operating systems. }}
