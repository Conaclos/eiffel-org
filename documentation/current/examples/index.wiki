EiffelStudio comes with a rich set of examples that you can use to learn how to use the many Eiffel facilities and libraries.

This book serves a different purpose ... actually two purposes.

First although some of the examples included here are provided by us at Eiffel Software, we hope that the majority of the entries will contributed by the people who use Eiffel daily to solve real problems.
