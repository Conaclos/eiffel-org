This sample consist of a command line showing how to interact with a database.

The DataReader object is somewhat synonymous with a read-only/forward-only cursor over data. The DataReader API supports flat as well as hierarchical data. A DataReader object is returned after executing a command against a database. The format of the returned DataReader object is different from a recordset. For example, you might use the DataReader to show the results of a search list in a web page.

# Launch EiffelStudio.
# Select '''Use existing Ace (control file)''' and click '''OK'''
# Browse to ''$ISE_EIFFEL\examples\dotnet\ado\ado3\''
# Choose the Ace file for the version of the .net framework you are running
# Choose the directory where the project will be compiled, by default the same directory containing the Ace file.
# Click '''OK'''.

==Under the Hood==

This application shows how to interact with a database. First the connection to the database is open ( <code> create </code> <code> my_sql_connection </code>. <eiffel>make_from_connection_string </eiffel> ( ''my_database'')), then a request to the database is made (create my_sql_command. <eiffel>make_from_cmd_text_and_connection </eiffel>( ''my_command'', <code> my_sql_connection </code>)). Finally, the result of the request is displayed. 

This sample contains the following class: 
*  <eiffel>SQL_DATA_READER</eiffel> 
*  <eiffel>SQL_CONNECTION</eiffel> 
*  <eiffel>SQL_COMMAND</eiffel> 

==Notes==

This sample is translated from the example located in the QuickStart\howto\samples\adoplus subdirectory of the .NET Framework SDK samples directory of Microsoft Visual Studio .NET.
