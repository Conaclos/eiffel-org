=Overview=

The EiffelRibbon design tool allows you to design a ribbon graphically, then generate the ribbon markup file and the Eiffel classes necessary to implement your design.

The interface of the design tool mimics that of [[EiffelBuild|EiffelBuild]]. That is, the interface contains three panes that have counterparts in EiffelBuild:

# Type selector: A list of all the elements available for use in a ribbon.
# Layout constructor: A structured view of the organization of the elements used in a particular ribbon design.
# Object editor: The properties of the ribbon element which is currently selected in the Layout constructor.

So, if you've used EiffelBuild, the the EiffelRibbon design tool should seem quite familiar to you. 

=Usage=

The typical usage of the design tool is much like the typical usage of EiffelBuild. 

* Create a new project ( <code lang="text">File -> New Project...</code> ) and choose a location for your EiffelRibbon project.
* Configure the ribbon by adding elements, name the elements, and choose icons for buttons.
* Save the project.
* Generate the code.
* Use EiffelStudio to compile the generated code.
