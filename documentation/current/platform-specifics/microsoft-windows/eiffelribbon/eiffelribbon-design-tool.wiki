=Overview=

The EiffelRibbon design tool allows you to design a ribbon graphically, then generate the ribbon markup file and the Eiffel classes necessary to implement your design.

The interface of the design tool mimics that of [[EiffelBuild|EiffelBuild]]. That is, the interface contains three panes that have counterparts in EiffelBuild:

# Type selector: A list of all the elements available for use in a ribbon.
# Layout constructor: A structured view of the organization of the elements used in a particular ribbon design.
# Object editor: The properties of the ribbon element which is currently selected in the Layout constructor.

So, if you've used EiffelBuild, the the EiffelRibbon design tool should seem quite familiar to you. 

=Usage=

The typical usage of the design tool is much like the typical usage of EiffelBuild. 

* Create a new project ( <code lang="text">File -> New Project...</code> ) and choose a location for your EiffelRibbon project.
* Configure the ribbon by adding elements, name the elements, and choose icons for buttons.
* Save the project.
* Generate the code.
* Use EiffelStudio to compile the generated code.

==Size definitions==

An important aspect of Microsoft's ribbon technology is called '''[http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/windows/desktop/dd316927(v=vs.85).aspx adaptive layout]'''. When the ribbon is resized by a user at runtime, adaptive layout makes corresponding changes to the size, format, organization and scale of the ribbon controls within each group based on size definition templates associated with the group. The ribbon framework provides a significant number of such templates (simply called '''size definitions'''), as shown in Figure 2 below. Size definitions are usually assigned names based on the number and type of controls included in the group. For example, the size definition ''"ThreeButtonsAndOneCheckBox"'' is a size definition for three buttons plus one checkbox.

In addition to using the size definitions provided, it is possible to create your own custom size definitions. You do this with the '''Size Definition Editor'''. At the lower left of Figure 1 above you can see the tab representing the Size Definition Editor. When you expand the tab, the editor becomes visible, as in Figure 3, below.
