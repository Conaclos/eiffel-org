:'''You can become a contributor!'''


EiffelStudio documentation is available in a convenient Wiki format. This makes it possible to improve the documentation continuously and make sure it is always up to date.

Community input is welcome. If you are interested in improving and developing EiffelStudio documentation, you can become:

* A contributor: authorized to edit existing pages to any book, and to add pages to the "Community contributions" book.
**"Community contributions" book pages can be added to other books by an editor.

* An editor: authorized to modify and add pages in any book.

To become a contributor, you should be proficient in Eiffel technology and have good written English skills. To become an editor, you should already be a contributor and have contributed significant improvements or additions to the documentation.

If you are interested in becoming a contributor, please send an email to info@eiffel.com with a short description of your Eiffel experience and any other relevant background.
