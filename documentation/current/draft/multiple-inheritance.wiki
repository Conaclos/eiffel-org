<h2>Multiple inheritance: overview</h2>

Multiple inheritance is a mechanism for combining abstractions. It lets you define a class by extending or specializing two or more classes, not just one as in <em>single</em> inheritance. 

Multiple inheritance sometimes has the reputation of being complicated or even messy, but there is no such problem in Eiffel. "Name clashes", for example, are not a big deal: if classes <eiffel>A</eiffel> and <e>B</e> both have a feature with the same name <e>f</e> and class <e>C</e> inherits from both,  


<e>
class feature end
</e>
