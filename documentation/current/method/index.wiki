== The Eiffel Method and Language ==

Here you can learn about the Eiffel development method and Eiffel the language.

At the heart of the Eiffel Development Framework is the Eiffel method. Everything else -- the language, the tools, the libraries -- exists because of the method. 

In order for us to communicate effectively about the activities of the method we must have some way to record the products of those activities. That is what Eiffel the language does for us ... with the added benefit that, ultimately, we implement whole running software systems in the language.

The method is laid out in wonderful detail in [http://www.eiffel.com/doc/oosc/ Object-oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition]. But, if you're just getting started, you will find some good introductory material on this page. The invitation to Eiffel is fairly short introduction to the method and language. and the tutorial gives a more detailed look.
