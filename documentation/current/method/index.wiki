== The Eiffel Method and Language ==

Here you can learn about the Eiffel development method and Eiffel the language.

At the heart of the Eiffel Development Framework is the Eiffel method. Everything else, the language, the tools, the libraries exist because of the method. The method is laid out in detail in Object-oriented Software Construction, 2nd Edition. But you will find some introductory material here. An "invitation" to Eiffel which is fairly short, and a tutorial which is more detailed.

In order for us to communicate effectively about the activities of the method we must some way to record the products of those activities. That is what Eiffel the language does for us ... with the added benefit that, ultimately, we implement whole running software systems in the language.
