Eiffel the Language is described in detail in the ISO/ECMA standard document, available [http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-367.htm online]. 

Sometimes there are differences between the language as defined by the standard and that which is implemented by Eiffel Software. These differences are documented in the online documentation.

So, the final authority on Eiffel as implemented by Eiffel Software is the content of the standard document, amended by those variances cited in the "differences" [[Differences between standard ECMA-367 and Eiffel Software implementation|chapter]] of the online documentation. 

The Quick Reference to Eiffel here to provide an informal guide to the language. Because this reference is based on the 2006 ISO/ECMA standard document, you should be aware that some differences may exist between what is in the Quick Reference and the implementation.
