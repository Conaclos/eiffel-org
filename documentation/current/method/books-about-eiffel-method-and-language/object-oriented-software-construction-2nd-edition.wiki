This Jolt Award winner takes the reader through the clear, logical, and comprehensive formation of a method for object-oriented software development. During this journey, Meyer also evolves a notation capable of expressing the products of each phase of development. This notation is Eiffel the language.


Roger Smith, on the Dr. Dobbs Journal website, writes:

:"In my unbiased opinion [...] it is destined to become the comprehensive and definitive reference for most methodological and technical questions raised by object technology. Its width and breadth of scope is impressive, from object-oriented techniques like Design by Contract and inheritance, to methodology issues like patterns and class design, to advanced issues like concurrency and persistence."


In ''Unix Review'', Stan Kelly-Bootle calls this book "The ultimate O-O guide."


Ian Graham, in ''Journal of Object-Oriented Programming'' calls it "Epoch-making".
