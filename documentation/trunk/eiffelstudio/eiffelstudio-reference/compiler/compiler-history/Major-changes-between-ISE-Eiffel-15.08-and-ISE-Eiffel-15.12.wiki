==What's new==
* Agents have a new type declaration. Instead of PROCEDURE [X, TUPLE [Y]], one can now write PROCEDURE [Y] where the first generic actual parameter is not considered anymore. The compiler accepts both syntax but only one per project, meaning that depending on the ECF version, it will either use the old syntax or the new one, and you cannot mix both syntax within the same project.

==Improvements==
* Introduced options to select the number of types being generated in each C directory via the general.cfg located in $ISE_EIFFEL/studio/eifinit. The first option is workbench_c_basket_limit for workbench code (defaulting at 33) and the other is finalized_c_basket_limit (defaulting at 50).

==Changes==

==Bug fixes==

===Language issues===
* Fixed bug#19120 (test#tuple019) by reporting the tuple field name that violated VUAR(2) for the corresponding assigner command.

===Compiler issues===

===SCOOP issues===
* Fixed test#scoop74 by propagating the controlled status of an object test expression to an object test local to avoid unnecessary wrapping for this local.
* Fixed test#scoop075 by allocating a separate call data structure register before message processing and by freeing it at the end of a call so that the register does not get incorrectly reused.

===Runtime/code generation issues===

===Store/Retrieve issues===
