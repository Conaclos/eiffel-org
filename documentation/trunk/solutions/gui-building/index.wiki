== Graphical user interface building solutions ==

Eiffel provides platform-independent graphical user interface (GUI) facilities, particularly:

*EiffelVision 2, a class library for building GUI applications.

*EiffelBuild, a GUI-builder, letting you devise your interfaces interactively and generating the corresponding calls to EiffelVision 2 mechanisms.
