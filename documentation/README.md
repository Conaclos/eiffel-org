# Overview 
- The documentation is written using wikitext syntax (mediawiki syntax).
- The structure of the folders is used to represent the books outline structure. Each folder can have a content using index.wiki file.
- Each wiki file can include optional wiki properties to set metadata, for instance:
    [[Property:title|The Title]]
    [[Property:description|A description]]
    [[Property:weight|10]]
    [[Property:uuid|68b37685-64e9-f564-9258-29e709a55f44]]
- The weight is used to order pages in parent.
- The uuid is used to provide a unique identifier for page.
- Templates and images are provided for all book, or for each book inside folders _templates and _images.
